This web application serves as a convenient portal by which anyone can explore the valuation of the top six market-valued cryptocurrencies. On the front page, we provide their exchange rates relative to bitcoin (captured at the time the page loaded). In the 'Explore' page, users can select two cryptocurrencies and two datetimes, and our app will automatically generate descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations within those specifications. In the 'History' page, we provide USD valuations and descriptive summaries of each of these cryptocurrencies. In the 'Comparison' page, we provide the USD valuation of bitcoin itself.
